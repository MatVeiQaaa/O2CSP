# O2CSP
An injected .dll to implement floating point based multiplier for note speed in O2Jam.

It works by moving conversion to integer after all the calculations are done, instead of converting multiplier to integer before calculations occure, which boost the precision of resulting value significantly, to the point its unnoticable to human eye.
